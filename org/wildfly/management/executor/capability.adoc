NAME: org.wildfly.management.executor

DESCRIPTION: Provides an executor service that can be used for running management-related tasks asynchronously. This executor is not meant to be used for tasks unrelated to management; e.g. for ordinary application request handling. The executor is configured with no task queue and no maximum number of threads; i.e. the user of the executor should assume submitting a task will result in a new thread being allocated. To promote thread reuse the executor may (likely will) have a small core pool and a short lifespan for non-core threads, but this is not part of the contract of this capability.
